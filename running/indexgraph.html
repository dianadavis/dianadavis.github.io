<title>Diana's relative performance over time</title>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Relative performance over time</font></p>

These graphs show my relative athletic performance over time, beginning when I was eleven years old and continuing up to early 2011.<p>
The charted value is computed by dividing the world record by my performance. For example, in 2003 I ran 5:47 for the indoor mile in high school. The world record for the indoor high school mile is 4:38.5. Dividing 4:38.5 by 5:47 yields 0.803, which you can see as one of the two dots on the horizontal 0.8 line between high school and college.<p>

Basically, I got better consistently through high school, got worse in college, and then have been improving consistently since entering grad school.

It is nice to be able to see this graphically, as in the following color-coded graph:

This picture separates the data points so that you know what team I was on when I had that performance. It is kind of hard to tell the difference between purple and brown, but it changes in May 2007.

This picture color-codes by distance, so that you can see what distances I am better at. The reason why the erg performances are so good as that the world records for erging are not nearly as good as the world records for running.

How good are these numbers, anyway? For comparison, here is my performance data charted with Alan's:
