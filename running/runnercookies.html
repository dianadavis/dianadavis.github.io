<b>Ingredients:</b><br><br>

(a)<br>
2 cups unsweetened applesauce<br>
2+1/2 cups packed brown sugar<br>
4 egg whites<br>
2 tsp. vanilla<br><br>

(b)<br>
2+1/2 cups whole wheat flour<br>
1/4 cup wheat germ<br>
*1/4 cup ground flax seed<br>
2 tsp. baking soda<br>
2 tsp. cinnoman<br>
1/2 tsp. nutmeg<br>
6 cups old-fashioned oats<br><br>

(c)<br>
2 cups raisins<br>
2 cups chocolate chips<br><br>

<font size=1>* Purchase flax seeds in the bulk natural foods section of the grocery store and grind them in a coffee-bean grinder.<br>
If you put in whole unground flax seeds, they will pass through your system undigested, without conferring their health benefits upon you.<br>
If you don't have wheat germ or flax seed, use 3 cups of flour instead of 2-1/2.</font></p>

<b>Directions:</b><br>
Blend (a) in mixer.<br>
Combine (b) in separate bowl and then add to mixer.<br>
Add (c) to mixer or stir in by hand.<br>
<i>Alternative Directions: Turn the mixer on and dump everything in. That works, too.</i><p>

Shape dough into patties on baking sheet. (They will not spread, so if you put little spheres in the oven, you'll get spherical little cookies.) Bake for 12-15 minutes at 375&deg;. Makes 72 cookies.
<i>Note: I always make a double batch, so the quantities above are for a double batch.</i><br><br>

You can also take a half batch of the above dough, press it into a 9 x 13 pan, and bake it for 25 minutes. If you cut it into 24 "granola bars," multiply each of the nutrition facts below by 1.5.<p>

(Clearly, the first assumption is ludicrous.)</font>
