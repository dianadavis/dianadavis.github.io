The red line is the mileage for each individual week.<br>
The green line is my average weekly mileage so far for the year -- it ended up being a respectable 33 miles per week.<br>
The blue line is my average mile for the previous eight weeks, which is thought to be a better indication than just the current week's mileage as to how much strength and accumulated fatigue the body has.
