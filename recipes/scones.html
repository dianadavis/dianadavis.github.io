<br>
<br>2 c. flour (up to half can be whole wheat)
<br>2 Tbsp sugar
<br>1 Tbsp baking powder
<br>1/2 tsp salt
<br>1/2 c. dried apricots, mini chocolate chips, nuts, dried cherries, etc.
<br>6 Tbsp butter or margarine
<br>1 beaten egg
<br>1/2 c. milk
<br>
<br>1 slightly beaten egg (so 2 eggs total)
<br>
<br>Stir thoroughly the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in apricots, etc. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add one beaten egg and milk, stirring just until dough clings together. Kneat gently on lightly floured surface (12 to 15 strokes). Cut dough in half. 
<br>
<br>Shape each half into a ball and pat or roll to 6-inch circle, about 1/2 inch thick. Cut each circle into 6 or 8 wedges. Place wedges on ungreased baking sheet (don't have sides touching). Brush scones with one slightly beaten egg. Bake at 425 until golden brown, about 12-15 minutes. Makes 12 to 16 scones.
