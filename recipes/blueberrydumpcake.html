<br>(before baking, then after baking)</p>

<br>1 pint blueberries (or 3 to 4 cups)
<br>1 small can crushed pineapple with juice
<br>1 box yellow or white cake mix
<br>1/2 cup broken walnuts or pecans
<br>1 1/2 sticks butter or margarine, melted
<br>
<br>Put berries in 9 x 13 pan and cover with pineapple. Pour on dry mix and scatter nuts over top. Melt and drizzle butter over all.
<br>
<br>Bake one hour at 350 (or a little less). Check so it doesn't burn.
<br>
<br>Serve with ice cream or whip. This is also great cold.
