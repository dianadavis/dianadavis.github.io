<p align="center"><font size="5">Barbecued Spare Ribs</font></p>

<br>Bake ribs in a single layer in an uncovered pan in 300-degree oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. This can be varied, longer in lower heat. Bake until brown. Drain off fat. Pour sauce over drained ribs. Bake 30-60 minutes longer. Baste occasionally. Add a little water if necessary.
<br>
<br>Sauce:
<br>2 Tbsp salad oil in a skillet. Add at least 1/2 cup finely-chopped onion. Saute until golden. Stir in remaining ingredients and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
<br>
<br>Add: 
<br>8 oz can of tomato sauce 
<br>1 c. ketchup
<br>2 Tbsp brown sugar
<br>1 tsp dry or prepared mustard
<br>1/3 c. vinegar or lemon juice
<br>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce (or more)
<br>1/2 c. water
<br>1 tsp salt
<br>1/4 tsp pepper
<br>
<br>All amounts can be varied as long as you get some sweet and some sour ingredients. I usually double the batch and freeze half.
