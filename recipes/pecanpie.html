<br>
<br>3 eggs
<br>2/3 c. sugar
<br>dash of salt
<br>1 c. dark corn syrup
<br>1/3 c. butter
<br>1 c. pecan halves
<br>
<br>Line 9-inch pie crust with pastry. Do not prick bottom. Flute edge. Beat eggs slightly; add sugar and salt and beat until dissolved. Stir in dark corn syrup and melted butter. Mix well. Add pecans. Place pie shell on oven rack (to prevent spilling when full) and pour filling in crust (can cover edges of crust with foil before filling to prevent over-browning). Bake at 350 for 25 minutes; remove foil from crust and make 25 min more or until knife comes out clean. 
<br>
<br>For cranberry pecan pie, add 1 cup coarsely chopped cranberries to filling.
<br>
<br>For orange pecan pie, add 1/2 tsp finely chopped orange peel and 1/2 c. finely chopped orange.
