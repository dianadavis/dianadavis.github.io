<br>
<br>Sweet roll dough:
<br>1/4 c. warm (110-115) water
<br>1 pkg dry yeast
<br>3/4 c. lukewarm milk (previously scalded so not so sticky)
<br>1/4 c. sugar
<br>1 tsp salt
<br>1 egg
<br>1/4 c. soft shortening
<br>3 1/2 - 3 3/4 c. flour
<br>
<br>In bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add milk, sugar, salt, egg, shortening and half of flour to yeast. Mix with spoon until smooth. Add enough flour to handle easily. 
<br>
<br>Turn onto lightly floured board. Knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl and turn it over so all is greased. Cover and let rise in warm (85 degree) place until doubled (1 1/2 hours). Punch down; let rise again, until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Shape and let rise (usually double) and bake as directed.
<br>
<br>If kitchen is cold, you cna place dough over a pan of hot water (on a rack) and cover with a towel. Or I heat the oven til it's at its lowest temp and shut it off and it gradually cools and heats the dough. Careful on this though.
<br>
<br>Butterscotch Rolls:
<br>After first rising of sweet roll dough, roll into oblong shape about 1/4 inch thick. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon. Roll and cut into 1-inch slices. Now combine 1 c. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp light corn syrup, 1/2 tsp burnt sugar flavoring, and 1 Tbsp butter in the baking pan until mixture melts together. Cool slightly and place rolls over this mixture. Let rise until double in bulk and bake at 375 for about 25 minutes. Remove from pan immediately, turning so butterscotch is on top of rolls. Pecans may be added to topping for rich pecan rolls.
