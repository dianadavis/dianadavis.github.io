<br>From Lily's Cookbook</p>
<br>
<br>10 new Red potatoes, cut in 1-inch cubes
<br>3/4 c. Hellman's mayonnaise
<br>3/4 c. sour cream
<br>1 1/2 tsp salt
<br>1/4 tsp black pepper
<br>3/4 tsp basil
<br>1/2 tsp granulated garlic
<br>
<br>Place cut potatoes in large pot and cover with COLD water. Bring to a boil; simmer until tender when poked with a knife. Drain. Mix remaining ingredients thoroughly. Stir in potatoes. They may be stirred in while warm or cool depending on your preference. 
<br>
<br>Notes: Other recipes say to combine the potatoes and dressing while they are warm, to absorb more flavor. 
<br>
<br>Kyra notes that it is important to use red potatoes and real Hellman's for the best flavor.
