<p style="font-family:optima"><b>Things to do</b><p>
<p style="font-family:optima">Deer Isle is far from everywhere else -- that's a feature, not a a bug. Since you're making the trip, we encourage you to take a few days, preferably a week, to explore the area. Here are some things to do.
<p>
<p style="font-family:optima"><i>On Deer Isle</i><br>
<ul>
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Explore <a href=https://www.stoningtonmaine.org/>Stonington</a>, a delightful fishing village
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Take a hike! <a href=https://www.islandheritagetrust.org/preserves-and-islands/>Here is a map</a> of the many places to explore. We especially recommend Barred Island, the Tennis Preserve and the Settlement Quarry.
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Take <a href=https://isleauhautferryservice.com/>the Mail Boat</a> from Stonington to the outlying islands
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Visit <a href=https://www.nervousnellies.com/>Nervous Nellie's</a>, explore Peter Beerits' magical village and then eat a hot scone with jam
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Watch the tide come in and out. Deer Isle experiences two 12-foot tides each day. You can actually watch the water level rise and fall in real time if you look closely.
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Read <a href=https://roamingtheamericas.com/deer-isle-stonington-maine-travel-guide/>this list of things to do</a> on Deer Isle.
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Eat tasty local seafood (see below).
</ul>
<p>
<p style="font-family:optima"><i>Further afield</i><br>
<ul>
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><a href=https://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm>Acadia National Park</a> is a national treasure. Diana's favorite parts are the carriage trails, and Thunder Hole (at mid-tide on an incoming tide).
<li><p style="font-family:optima">The <a href=https://www.maine.gov/mdot/pnbo/>Penobscot Narrows Bridge</a> is the highest suspension bridge observatory in the world, and the only one in the U.S. The historic Fort Knox is adjacent.
<li><p style="font-family:optima">Cute towns: Castine, Belfast, and basically all the other towns along Route 1 in Maine also
</ul>


<hr>
<a name=eat></a> 

<p style="font-family:optima"><b>Things to eat</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Lobster:</b> Stonington is the largest lobster fishery in Maine. We recommend purchasing live lobsters at the Stonington Lobster Co-Op, or eating a prepared lobster dinner at the Harbor Cafe in Stonington.
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Crab:</b> Arguably more delicious than lobster. We recommend purchasing crab meat at Coldwater Seafood in Stonington.
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Clams:</b> Digging clams is a staple of the island economy for many people who want to live off of harvesting seafood but don't have a lobster boat. They are delicious both steamed and fried. 
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Mussels:</b> We used to be able to harvest them right off of our rocks, but commercial fishermen with drag nets over-fished the area and somehow they all disappeared. The commercial fishermen are still finding them somewhere. They're delicious steamed, which is how we always fixed them, and they're also great smoked; you can buy those at Coldwater Seafood in Stonington. 
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Oysters:</b> Abby Barrows cultivates oysters in her <a href=http://www.longcoveseafarm.com/contact-purchase>Long Cove Sea Farm</a> a half-mile kayak ride from our home. Click the link for information on how to buy them.
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Fried fish:</b> Go to the Fish Fry on Friday nights (other nights are also great) at the Harbor Cafe in Stonington.
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Smoked fish:</b> Richard Penfold smokes great fish. <a href=https://www.stoningtonseafood.com/>Further information here</a>.
</ul>

<p style="font-family:optima"><b>Restaurants</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Harbor Cafe</b> in downtown Stonington is where the locals go year 'round. They sell lots of seafood and have a large menu of other options. 
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>There's A Treat</b> on Route 15 north of Deer Isle Village. A takeout place with picnic tables and really great fried fish. 
<li><p style="font-family:optima"><b>Aragosta</b> at Goose Cove Lodge is a beautiful place with a great view and great food. In summer 2020 for lunch there was eat-in or take-out, and for dinner it was a fixed price tasting menu for $80. 
</ul>

<p style="font-family:optima"><b>Grocery stores</b><p>
<ul>
<p style="font-family:optima"><b>The Galley</b> and <b>Burnt Cove Market</b> are two grocery stores on the island. The Galley is a mile north of Deer Isle village on Rt 15 and Burnt Cove Market is across from Burnt Cove (duh) on 15A about a mile north of Stonington. You can buy food there and then cook it.
</ul>

<p style="font-family:optima"><b>Gifts:</b> We are fortunate to have most everything we need to build a wonderful life. We are so grateful that you are coming to share this day with us, and that's all we need from you. If you'd really like to bring a gift, here are some suggestions.
<ul>
